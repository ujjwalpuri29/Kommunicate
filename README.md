### **Question 4**:
My best project would be the website I developed for my internship with Optshine Digitech Solutions. I developed the CSR domain website of the organisation with a team of 6 using ReactJS. I was given the responsibility of creating the homepage and the login/register portal. This project challenged me as it required me to worked with ReactJS, which I previously did not have any experience with. It was a great learning experience as it gave me the opportunity to work with experienced individuals, whose guidance helped me turn the ideas and expectations into the website.

### **Question 5**:
In their initial stages, startups require dedicated and solution-oriented people who are willing to put in extra efforts for success. For my startup, I would choose my classmates Kshitij Ramrakhiani and Sanskriti Khare. Kshitij is the secretary of our college fest, and has the skills needed to market our startup to potential investors. Another skill needed for a successful startup is an eye for detail, for which Sanskriti would be the perfect match.
